Protobuild Index - Google App Engine
========================================

This (small) Google App Engine application is used to provide APIs over HTTP for the Google Search API.  Since Google doesn't provide native HTTP endpoints for adding and querying data in the full text search API, this application allows packages to be indexed and queried on.

In order to run your own Protobuild index, you'll probably need to change the application name.
